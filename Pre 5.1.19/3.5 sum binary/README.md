# Code Wars Problem 3.5.19
The challenge was to create a function that adds two numbers and returns the sum of those numbers in binary form.

## How It's Made:

Just Javascript. A simple application of .toString to the sum and making sure .toString has (2) after it made it so the number was converted to a 2-base number system (binary).

## Optimizations
It wouldn't have been an optimization but I could have also done this by doing the actual calculation of converting a number to binary. That would be some obnoxious and time consuming math to learn and implement, however, so I'm very glad Javascript has .toString being able to convert numbers as a native function.

## Lessons Learned:

I didn't know .toString could be used to convert numbers to different number-base systems, it's a very useful tool.

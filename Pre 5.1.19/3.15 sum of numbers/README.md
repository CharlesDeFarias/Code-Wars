## How It's Made:

ES6 using only for loop and conditional

## Optimizations
I could have done this in shorter code if I were more comfortable with arrays and using .sort. Likewise, if I wanted the code to run faster, I could have the for loop moving up and down at the same time, meeting in the middle of the array so that the code executes in half the time.

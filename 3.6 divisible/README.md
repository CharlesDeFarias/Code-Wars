# My portfolio website
This is my first (though definitely not final) attempt at a personal portfolio website. I used a template located here: https://github.com/bmorelli25/portfolio-template

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and soon Javascript

This was a really simple template that came with no responsiveness and only HTML and CSS. I've made basic changes to the HTML and will be making the site more responsive before adding Javascript for more fluid navigation of the side and general effects to make it more pleasant.

## Optimizations
There's a lot of work to be done on this website. I need to make it more responsive and also restructure the HTML itself. In particular, it bothers me how space is created on this template using empty anchor tags instead of margin or padding. I want to make it so my portfolio is easier to read and in general, I want to make the site more compact which seems to be my natural tendency

## Lessons Learned:

Mostly, I learned that I hate templates and need to practice using them a lot more as they're an unfortunate necessity of being a software engineer. I encountered a lot of scary templates with several files with code I couldn't understand like SASS.

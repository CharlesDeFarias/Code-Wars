//3 kyu
//lift doesn't change direction until everyone that's heading in that direction has gotten off and on
//When empty and going up, it might go to the highest floor being called to work its way down
//when going down, it might ignore calls to go down to first floor to collect people and then work upwards
//Lift has a max capacity but even when full, will stop at all floors its called and open doors
//If lift is waiting and nobody's called, it will go to ground floor.
//people go into elevator in order of their numbers (numbers are the floors they're going to)
//only people going in the same direction as the elevator can enter
//input: queue, array of arrays of numbers. capacity = max people in the lift at the same time.
//output: array of ints listing the floors it stopped at in the order visited
var theLift = function(queues, capacity) {
    // Starts on ground floor and is going to go up, collecting everybody that's going up, as capacity allows

    return [999]
